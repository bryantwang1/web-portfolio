<!-- I could've sworn the assignment didn't include Bootstrap when I glanced at it last night... maybe I'm just blind. At any rate, I'll link it here just to show I know how to add it to my own sites, but since I only noticed the Bootstrap requirement after finishing two pages I probably won't use any of its styles. If it isn't enough to demonstrate that I know how to use the Bootstrap css file (just like any other css basically...and columns go inside rows go inside containers, rows are 12 units wide, etc.) then I suppose I'll be resubmitting. -->
<!-- Note: also I just commented the link to bootstrap.css out after adding it because it screws up some of my site due to its default styling. -->

          In despair at being unable to figure out why a webpage won't behave. Image <em>may or may not</em> resemble Bryant Wang... it doesn't. I don't have any pictures of myself on hand though, so here you go. Also I don't even like Apple.
